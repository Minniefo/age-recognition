## Age and Gender Detection System
This project is an Age and Gender Detection System built using OpenCV and machine learning techniques. The system utilizes pre-trained models to analyze facial features and accurately predict the age group and gender of individuals from images or live video feeds.

## Features
- Real-time Detection: Detects and classifies age and gender in real-time using a webcam or video input.
- Image Analysis: Processes static images to predict age and gender.
- Robust Performance: Uses OpenCV's pre-trained models for high accuracy and efficiency.
## Technologies Used
- OpenCV: For image processing and real-time facial detection.
- Pre-trained Models: Age and gender prediction models trained on large datasets.
- Python: Core programming language for implementation.
## How It Works
- Face Detection: The system detects faces in the input image or video using OpenCV's Haar cascades or DNN-based models.
- Age and Gender Prediction: The detected face is passed through pre-trained models to predict:
- Age Group: Categorized into predefined age ranges (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, etc.).
- Gender: Male or Female.
- Output Display: The predicted age and gender are overlaid on the image or video feed.
